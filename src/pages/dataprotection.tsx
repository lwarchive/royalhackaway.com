        <p>
          We recognise our responsibility as an organisation collecting personal
          data to handle that data in a way that is commensurate with the Data
          Protection Act and our values as an organisation.
        </p>
        <p>The law states:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully</li>
          <li>
            Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and
            lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner
            incompatible with that purpose or purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in
            relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to
            date.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be
            kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those
            purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of
            data subjects (individuals).
          </li>
          <li>
            Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken
            against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and
            against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal
            data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory
            outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory
            ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms
            of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.
