We respect your privacy - You can opt out of being photographed by asking one of our committee members for an "opt-out" lanyard, to let us know that you do not wish to be photographed.

We'll try to do the following:

1. Avoid taking photographs of people who have opted-out
2. Delete photographs of those who have opted-out
3. Triple check for people who have opted-out before publishing photographs

If you are from the _future_ ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ and have still found yourself in a photograph, let us know at [hello@computingsociety.co.uk][1]
